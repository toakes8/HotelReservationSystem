PYTHON APP

Within this program lies to python files. AppointmentGUI and Logtest. 

AppointmentGUI when ran brings up a gui that allows for the creation of tickets. 

Logtest is the program that can read these log files.

Logfiles are generated with a unique ID and that unique id is how the logtest program can read the file. 

In this program we have a couple pregenerated logfiles random numbers between 1-999 are the logfiles generated by the AppointmentGUI program.

Logfiles with numbers and letters with a dash such as "1aa1-a11a" are generated by the webapplication also in this program under the WEBSITE FOLDER\


WEBAPP

To use the webapp, just launch the Website.html file and make a ticket.

That ticket will be stored in your downloads folder, during the demonstration we made our google chrome save files to the project folder itself,
but moving the file to the folder would work just as well.
